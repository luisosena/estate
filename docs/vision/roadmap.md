## Upcoming Work

### Activate Payment Gateway

**Goal:** Enable the scaffolded payment gateway layer so tenants can pay via M-Pesa STK push.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Register `PaymentGatewayServiceProvider` in `bootstrap/providers.php` | ⬜ | |
| Wire `routes/webhooks.php` into `bootstrap/app.php` | ⬜ | |
| Implement M-Pesa STK push initiation endpoint | ⬜ | |
| Implement M-Pesa callback handler (`MpesaWebhookController`) | ⬜ | |
| Test `PaymentConfirmed` event → `ProcessPaymentConfirmed` listener chain end-to-end | ⬜ | |
| Mobile: integrate payment initiation flow in `MakePaymentScreen` | ⬜ | |
| Add gateway payment status tracking to mobile payment history | ⬜ | |

**Definition of done:** Tenant can initiate M-Pesa payment from mobile, receive STK push, complete payment, and see confirmed status with auto-generated receipt.

### Landing Page & Onboarding

**Goal:** Public-facing landing page and streamlined onboarding for new landlords and tenants.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Design and implement landing page (`/`) | ✅ Complete | 9-section page with bento grid pain-solution, animations, responsive design |

| "Forgot password" flow polish | ⬜ | |

**Definition of done:** A visitor can land on the site, understand the product, sign up as a landlord, and have their first property ready to accept tenants within 5 minutes.

---

### CSV Bulk Import

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| CSV template download | ✅ Complete | Generated in-memory via `fputcsv` — no file on disk, immune to test cleanup |
| File upload and parsing | ✅ Complete | `SplFileObject` CSV parser, BOM-safe, empty-row skipping, whitespace trim |
| Data validation with row-level error reporting | ✅ Complete | Laravel `Validator` per row, cross-row duplicate detection, pre-loaded occupied-unit check |

| Auto-create user accounts for imported tenants | ✅ Complete | Creates `User` with `must_change_password = true` when tenant email is provided |
| Import history and audit log | ✅ Complete | `CsvImportBatch` with `row_errors`, `import_summary`, `completed_at` |
| Notifications on import completion | ✅ Complete | `CsvImportCompleted` sent to landlord + all admins |

**Definition of done:** Landlord downloads template, fills in their existing portfolio data, uploads it, reviews any errors, and completes the import with all records created correctly. ✅ **Achieved.**

**Implementation details:** `CsvImportService` (443 lines), `CsvImportBatch` model + factory, `CsvImportBatchPolicy`, 28 feature tests.
